# EEAIC 2022

Repository for documentation purposes of our project in the ETHZ course EEAIC, edition 2022.

We implemented the paper from Faroni et al. [1] to implement a Class-D VCO as part of a whole PLL.
Overall , we achieved a FoM @ 10 MHz of -190.14 dBc/Hz, with a total power budget of less than 4mW and a reference clock of 31.25MHz.
